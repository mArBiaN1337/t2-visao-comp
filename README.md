- Homography Estimation with RANSAC after DLT with Normalization.

- Make sure to select the Image from the Sets available in the /images folder. 

- First, select from a number [1 to 8] to represent the set using the variable "SET_NUMBER".

- Inside the corresponding "/images/set" folder, chose two numbers to represent the images to run the program with.
