    pip install -r requirements.txt
  
- Inside the project directory, use to run the program:

    python3 ./main.py

# t2-visao-comp

- Homography Estimation with RANSAC after DLT with Normalization.

- Make sure to select the Image from the Sets available in the /images folder. 

- First, select from a number [1 to 8] to represent the set using the variable "SET_NUMBER".

- Inside the corresponding "/images/set" folder, chose two numbers to represent the images to run the program with. 

- The chosen numbers must be in a Tuple inside the variable "IMG_SELECT". 

- Adjust the "RANSAC_THRESHOLD" value associated with the threshold in the ransac function.
